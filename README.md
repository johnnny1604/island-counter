# Island Counter

## Description

A small library for counting the number of contiguous elements in a 2D matrix.

A cluster of elements (island) will only be considered as such,
if the cells are connected from any of the four general directions.
Diagonally connected cells do not count as part of the same island.

## Quickstart

```sh
$ npm install
```
